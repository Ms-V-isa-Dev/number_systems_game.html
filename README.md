### Learning Tips

#### Understanding Binary (Base 2)
- Only uses digits: **0 and 1**
- Each position is a power of 2: **128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1**
- Example: 10001010 = 128 + 8 + 2 = 138

#### Understanding Hexadecimal (Base 16)
- Uses digits: **0-9 and A-F**
- **A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15**
- Each hex digit = exactly 4 binary digits
- Example: F = 15 = 1111

#### Conversion Strategies

**Decimal to Binary:**
1. Start with powers of 2: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
2. Find the largest power that fits in your number
3. Place a 1 in that position, subtract, and continue
4. Fill remaining positions with 0s

**Binary to Decimal:**
1. Write powers of 2 above each binary digit
2. Add up all positions where there's a 1
3. That's your decimal answer!

**Hex to Binary:**
1. Convert each hex digit separately using the chart
2. Each hex digit becomes 4 binary digits
3. Combine them together

**Binary to Hex:**
1. Group binary from right to left in sets of 4
2. Add leading zeros if needed
3. Convert each group of 4 to a hex digit

**Hex to Decimal:**
1. Each position is a power of 16: 16³, 16², 16¹, 16⁰
2. Multiply each hex digit by its position value
3. Add all products together

**Decimal to Hex:**
1. Divide your number by 16
2. The remainder is your rightmost hex digit
3. Keep dividing the quotient by 16
4. Read all remainders from bottom to top
